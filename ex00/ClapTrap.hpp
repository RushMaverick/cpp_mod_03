/*When ClapTrack attacks, it causes its target to lose <attack damage> hit points.
When ClapTrap repairs itself, it gets <amount> hit points back. Attacking and repairing
cost 1 energy point each. Of course, ClapTrap canâ€™t do anything if it has no hit points
or energy points left.
In all of these member functions, you have to print a message to describe what hap-
pens. For example, the attack() function may display something like (of course, without
the angle brackets):
ClapTrap <name> attacks <target>, causing <damage> points of damage!
The constructors and destructor must also display a message, so your peer-evaluators
can easily see they have been called.
Implement and turn in your own tests to ensure your code works as expected.
